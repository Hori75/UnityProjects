Here's what I have worked on with Unity

### Dog and Bullet
This is a plane-shooter game. The most basic one that spawns enemies randomly and enemies fires randomly at player.
I'm still confused on how to create level pattern so we could create levels.

### Journey of the Lost
This is a story-based game. I learnd about json and whatever related to storing and bla bla bla...
